# 🧾 Git-Tracker v2 — Step 6 Report  
## Step 6 · Logging & Health Check (Lifecycle Integration)

### 🪄 Overview
Step 6 gave the tracker a **heartbeat** and a **black-box recorder**.  
It now logs every run, prevents overlapping executions, and performs quick health checks before scanning repositories.

---

## ✅ Work Completed

### 1. Utility Creation (6.1)
| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `tracker/utils/logger.js` | Writes daily log files in `data/logs/`, prints to console, and formats section headers. | ✅ |
| `tracker/utils/lock.js` | Creates / removes `tracker.lock` to prevent concurrent runs and detect stale locks. | ✅ |
| `tracker/utils/health.js` | Checks that the database exists, is writable, and warns if no successful run occurred in the last 36 hours. | ✅ |

All three were tested independently (`tests/test_logger.js`, `tests/test_lock.js`, `tests/test_health.js`) and worked perfectly.

---

### 2. Lifecycle Integration (6.2)
Integrated all utilities into `coreTracker.js`:

1. **Pre-flight phase**
   - Starts timer, logs section start.  
   - Acquires lock → DB check → freshness warning.

2. **Execution phase**
   - Performs the existing repo scan and statistics logic.

3. **Wrap-up phase**
   - Inserts a summary record into the `runs` table.  
   - Logs success or failure message.  
   - Releases the lock (always executed in `finally`).

4. **Error handling**
   - Added `try / catch / finally` wrapper to guarantee cleanup even on crash.

---

### 3. Schema Adjustment
While testing, SQLite reported:

```
[ERROR] Failed to insert run record: table runs has no column named started_at
```

✅ Fix: added `started_at` and `finished_at` columns to the `runs` table using  
`tracker/db/update_runs_table.js`.

---

### 4. Major Obstacles and Resolutions
| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **`better-sqlite3` version mismatch** | Node 20 was running a binary built for Node 22. | Rebuilt the module with `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`. |
| **`Cannot find module … test_logger.js`** | Executed from inside `/tracker` using a duplicated path. | Corrected to `node tests/test_logger.js`. |
| **Initial run warning** | No previous success in DB. | Kept as harmless 36-hour freshness warning. |
| **Missing columns in `runs`** | Old DB schema from Step 1. | Added `started_at`, `finished_at`. |

---

### 5. Verification Results
- Log file created under `data/logs/tracker-YYYY-MM-DD.log` ✅  
- Lock file created → released ✅  
- Warning issued correctly ✅  
- Daily totals & repo stats updated ✅  
- Run summary inserted into DB ✅  
- Console and log outputs match ✅  

---

### 🎯 Outcome
Git-Tracker now has:
- Complete, timestamped run history.  
- Safety against overlapping executions.  
- Self-diagnostic logging for any failure.  
- Foundation for future dashboard analytics.  

✅ **Step 6 — Completed Successfully**

# 🔮 Step 7 · Verifier Enhancement (Planned)

### 🧩 Purpose
The **Verifier** (the small Electron popup scheduled for 11 : 15 PM) currently checks only whether today’s totals exist in `daily_totals`.  
In Step 7, it becomes a **true system health monitor**.

---

### 🪄 Step 7 Goals
| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Integrate runs table** | Read the latest record from `runs` to show *“Last Run Success / Failed”*, time taken, and repo count. |
| **2. Show recent status summary** | Display the last 3–5 runs with timestamps and durations inside the popup. |
| **3. Color-coded UI** | Green = success (≤ 24 h old), Yellow = warning (> 36 h old), Red = failure or no run. |
| **4. Direct log access** | Button: “View Last Run Log” opens today’s log file in Notepad. |
| **5. Retry button upgrade** | “Retry Now” triggers `coreTracker.js` again with clear progress feedback. |

---

### 🧠 Why it matters
With the Verifier upgraded:
- You’ll know each night’s run result **at a glance**.  
- Failures or missed schedules won’t stay hidden.  
- The system becomes **self-auditing**, laying groundwork for the later **web dashboard**.

---

### 📅 Next Actions
1. Modify `verifyTracker.js` to query the `runs` table.  
2. Display status + duration in `verifyWindow.html`.  
3. Add buttons for “View Log” and “Retry Now”.  
4. Schedule 11 : 15 PM Verifier Task test again.
