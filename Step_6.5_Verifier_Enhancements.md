# 🧩 Step 7 — Verifier Enhancement

**Git-Tracker v2 Development Log**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Enhance the post-tracking verification system to provide a clear, visual summary of recent tracker runs, overall health, and logging visibility through an Electron popup window.

---

## 🏗️ Implemented Features

### ✅ 7.1 – Recent Run Retrieval

- Added `getRecentRuns(limit)` to read the latest entries from the `runs` table.
- Displays the five most recent tracker runs (date, duration, repo count) inside the Verifier window.

### ✅ 7.2 – Health Evaluation

- Implemented `evaluateHealth(runs)` to compute system status:
  - 🟢 Green = last run successful within 36 h
  - 🟡 Yellow = no successful run > 36 h
  - 🔴 Red = last run failed
- Displays human-readable message and color indicator at the top of the Verifier.

### ✅ 7.3 – Verifier UI (Window)

- New Electron popup (750 × 600 px) with dark theme and clear layout.
- Sections: Health Status → Recent Runs → Control Buttons → Today’s Log.
- Fully resizable and bundler-ready.

### ✅ 7.4 – View Log Button

- Opens today’s `tracker-YYYY-MM-DD.log` in Notepad (Windows) using a robust `execFile()` call.
- Handles missing file gracefully.

### ✅ 7.5 – Automatic Log Viewer

- Added an integrated log viewer inside the Verifier window.
- Automatically loads today’s log on startup – no clicks required.
- Scrollable dark panel displays the raw log text in monospace font.
- Displays ⚠️ “No log file found for today.” if none exists.

### ✅ 7.6 – Environment Stability (Fixed critical bug)

- Introduced **dual-module architecture** to prevent ABI mismatch between Node and Electron:
  - `node_modules/` → used by Node Tracker (coreTracker.js)
  - `electron_modules/` → used by Electron Verifier (verifyTracker.js)
- Updated `health.js` to dynamically choose the correct build.
- Verified both environments run independently with no rebuild conflicts.

### ✅ 7.7 – Cross-Testing

- Confirmed:
  - `node tracker/coreTracker.js` runs normally and generates logs.
  - `npx electron tracker/verifyTracker.js` opens Verifier and displays data.
  - Both can be executed back-to-back without re-compilation.

---

## ⚙️ Partially Complete (Deferred to Step 8)

### 🔄 Retry Now Button (System Rerun)

- **Current:** Functional prototype that launches `coreTracker.js` from the Verifier.
- **Next Step (8):** Add process-locking, progress indicator, and automatic UI refresh after completion.

## 🧩 Issues Encountered & Resolutions

| Issue                                                   | Resolution                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `better_sqlite3` ABI mismatch between Node and Electron | Created `electron_modules/` folder and rebuilt separate binaries             |
| Log viewer not showing content                          | Implemented `show-log` IPC event and auto-load on `did-finish-load`          |
| Duplicate `ipcMain` declaration                         | Merged imports into single `{ app, BrowserWindow, ipcMain, shell }` require  |
| Notepad not opening from Electron                       | Switched to `execFile("C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe")` for reliability |
| Missing log files                                       | Added graceful fallback and message display                                  |
| Layout too small                                        | Resized window to 750 × 600 px and adjusted padding                          |
| Environment rebuild conflicts                           | Solved permanently via dual-module approach                                  |

## 🧠 Outcome

The Verifier is now a **self-diagnosing health dashboard**:

- Instantly displays tracker status and logs.
- Operates independently of rebuild conflicts.
- Serves as a foundation for the future dashboard and bundled `.exe`.

---

## 🚀 Next Step (8) Preview – “Retry Now” Enhancement

1. Add lock protection to prevent duplicate tracker runs.
2. Display a “Running…” indicator and disable the Retry button during execution.
3. Refresh `runs` and `log` automatically when the tracker finishes.
4. Catch errors and show friendly messages in the Verifier UI.
5. Prepare the rerun process for seamless integration with the future Task Scheduler automation.
