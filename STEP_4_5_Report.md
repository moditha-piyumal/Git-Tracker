# Git-Tracker v2 — Steps 4 & 5 Report (Automation + Verification System)

**Goal:** Automate the Git-Tracker to run daily and add a verification system that confirms whether the daily activity was successfully logged.

---

## ✅ Step 4 — Automation (Windows Task Scheduler)

### 🎯 Objective
To make the tracker run automatically every night at 11:00 PM, ensuring daily data is always captured without manual execution.

### 🧱 What We Did
- Combined **repoScanner.js** and **coreTracker.js** into a single automated pipeline:
  - The tracker automatically runs the repo scanner before measuring daily activity.
  - Ensures new repositories are always detected before tracking begins.

- Created a **Windows Task Scheduler** entry to execute the tracker at **11:00 PM**.
- Used a `.bat` launcher (`run_git_tracker.bat`) to ensure clean exits and reliable automation.
- Fixed the “Running but not stopping” issue in Task Scheduler by adding `process.exit(0)` at the end of `coreTracker.js`.
- Confirmed `errorlevel = 0` to validate successful termination.
- Adjusted Task Scheduler **Settings** and **Conditions** to guarantee reliable execution under all conditions.

### ⚙️ Batch Launcher Details
**run_git_tracker.bat:**
```bat
@echo off
cd /d "C:\Moditha_DevHub\1-Portfolio_Worthy_Projects\git-tracker-v2\tracker"
echo [%date% %time%] Starting Git-Tracker...
node coreTracker.js
echo [%date% %time%] Git-Tracker finished with exit code %errorlevel%.
exit /b 0
```
- Prevents the Task Scheduler “Running” state bug.
- Guarantees clean start/finish signals to Windows.
- Allows easy logging if desired.

### 🧩 Final Automation Chain
| Time | Script | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| **11:00 PM** | `coreTracker.js` (via `run_git_tracker.bat`) | Scans repos + collects daily stats |
| **11:15 PM** | `verifyTracker.js` (via `.vbs` wrapper) | Confirms data recorded + shows popup |

### ✅ Result
The system now runs automatically each night without any manual intervention. It finishes cleanly, updates the database, and prepares for verification.

## ✅ Step 5 — Verification & Auto-Recovery System

### 🎯 Objective
To confirm each day’s data was successfully recorded, and automatically alert (or recover) if not.

### 🧱 What We Built

#### 1️⃣ **verifyTracker.js** (Backend)
- Connects to SQLite DB to check if today’s date exists in `daily_totals`.
- Launches an Electron popup with one of two modes:
  - **Success Mode:** shows a green confirmation message.
  - **Fail Mode:** shows a warning with Retry and Close buttons.
- Retry button re-runs `coreTracker.js` automatically via `child_process.spawn`.

#### 2️⃣ **verifyWindow.html + verifyWindow.js** (Frontend)
- Elegant, responsive popup built in Electron.
- **Success mode:** 🎉 green message + Close button.  
- **Fail mode:** ⚠️ orange message + Retry/Close buttons.
- Fully isolated in `tracker/ui` folder for future reuse.

#### 3️⃣ **Task Scheduler Integration (11:15 PM)**
- Created a second scheduled task “Git-Tracker Verification.”
- Runs silently using a `.vbs` wrapper to hide the command prompt.

**run_verifier.vbs:**
```vbscript
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run "cmd /c npx electron "C:\Moditha_DevHub\1-Portfolio_Worthy_Projects\git-tracker-v2\tracker\verifyTracker.js"", 0, False
```
- Uses `wscript.exe` to launch without console window.
- Maintains independence between tracker and verifier.

### 🧩 Verification Logic Summary
```
[verifyTracker.js]
       │
       ▼
  Check daily_totals table
       │
       ├── Record found → Success popup 🎉
       │
       └── Record missing → Warning popup ⚠️ + Retry option
```

### ✅ Result
- The verifier confirms each night’s success visually.
- Automatically reruns the tracker if data is missing.
- Runs silently in the background (no console windows).
- Both success and fail paths tested and confirmed working.

## 🧭 Overall Outcome (Steps 4 & 5)

| Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Automatic 11 PM Tracker | Runs without user input | ✅ |
| Repo scanner integration | Always tracks new repos | ✅ |
| Clean exits / 0x0 result | Reliable task completion | ✅ |
| Verification at 11:15 PM | Confirms data presence | ✅ |
| Electron popup alerts | Success + Retry modes | ✅ |
| Hidden background launch | Silent `.vbs` execution | ✅ |
| Retry capability | Can re-run tracker automatically | ✅ |

---

## 🧠 What We Learned
- Task Scheduler requires explicit exit signals (`process.exit(0)` or `.bat` wrapping) to close cleanly.
- Silent automation can be achieved using `.vbs` wrappers instead of `npx` directly.
- Combining Electron for notifications creates a friendly and modern UX even for background tools.
- Keeping each process modular (scanner, tracker, verifier) maintains flexibility and reliability.

---

## 🔜 Next Steps
**Step 6 — Logging & Health Check**
- Implement lightweight logging (`runs` table + `tracker.log`).
- Record start time, end time, duration, and outcome (success/failure).
- Add optional “View Logs” button in the future dashboard.

> With Steps 4 and 5 complete, Git-Tracker v2 is now fully autonomous and self-verifying. You’ve built a daily self-tracking system that runs, checks, and reports on its own. 🚀
